<h1>Hobbies</h1>
<p1>I really enjoy walking the streets of my city, this helps me a lot to clarify my ideas about my long-term goals in all facets of my life.</p1><br />
<p1>I am a music lover, I studied 2 years at the Conservatorio Nacional Germán Alcántara, in my free time, or more importantly when I have enough inspiration, I like to take my violin and compose little melodies that are known in the musical world as ¨fantasías¨.</p1>
